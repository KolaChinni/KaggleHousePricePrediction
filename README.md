🏠 House Price Prediction using XGBoost & Scikit-Learn

This project builds a high-performance regression pipeline for predicting house prices using advanced feature engineering, robust preprocessing, and XGBoost regression, inspired by the Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition.

📌 Project Overview

Goal: Predict house sale prices accurately using structured tabular data

Dataset: Kaggle House Prices (train.csv, test.csv)

Target Variable: SalePrice (log-transformed)

Evaluation Metric: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

🚀 Key Highlights

Extensive feature engineering based on domain knowledge

Outlier removal for better generalization

Automatic numerical & categorical preprocessing

Log transformation for skewed features and target

XGBoost Regressor with strong regularization

Clean train / validation split

Ready-to-use Kaggle submission pipeline
